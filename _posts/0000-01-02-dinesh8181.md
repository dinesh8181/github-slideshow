# **1. Introduction**
---
- Breast cancer being the most common amongst women is the second leading cause of death in the human population. A tumor type of abnormal growth is identified which can be Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous).

- This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is carried out for Breast Cancer Survival. 

- EDA will gives us the more insight about patients survial at different stages of life.
- Hence, will bring the awareness of Breast Cancer in the society and survival upon timely treatement.

# **2. Problem Statement**
---

- First of all the awareness and education about this life threatening disease is very important than anything else.It takes place every year on 4 February. World Cancer Day aims to prevent millions of deaths each year by raising awareness and education about cancer, and pressing governments and individuals across the world to take action against the disease.

- **Example Problem Statement:**

  - Cancer is life threatening disease and entire globe is facing it .

  - There are various types of Cancers and we need quite awareness about those.

  - Here, we are focusing on the data available for Breast Cancer.
  
<p align="center"><img width=60% src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Breast_Cancer_Awareness_%28263497131%29.jpg/220px-Breast_Cancer_Awareness_%28263497131%29.jpg"></p>

- Derive a scenario related to the problem statement and heads on to the journey of exploration.

- **Example Scenario:**
  - Breast Cancer is one of the type of cancer its widely spread and particularly in women.

  - The information contains the cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicagoâ€™s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

  - They are trying to find the pattern of patient's survival based on patient's age, number of nodes and year of operation.

  - But their traditional systems are not up to the mark to find out deeper patterns.

  - To tackle this problem they hired a genius team of data scientists. Consider you are one of them...

# **3. Installing & Importing Libraries**
---

- This section is emphasised on installing and importing the necessary libraries that will be required.

### **Installing Libraries**

!pip install -q datascience                                         # Package that is required by pandas profiling
!pip install -q pandas-profiling                                    # Library to generate basic statistics about data
# To install more libraries insert your code here..

### **Upgrading Libraries**

- **After upgrading** the libraries, you need to **restart the runtime** to make the libraries in sync.

- Make sure not to execute the cell under Installing Libraries and Upgrading Libraries again after restarting the runtime.

!pip install -q --upgrade pandas-profiling                          # Upgrading pandas profiling to the latest version

### **Importing Libraries**

- You can headstart with the basic libraries as imported inside the cell below.

- If you want to import some additional libraries, feel free to do so.

# **4. Data Acquisition & Description**
---

- Before going further we have a good idea about the features of the data set:

| Records | Features | Dataset Size |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 306 | 04 | 3.1 KB|



|Id|Feature|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|01|Age| Age of the patient at the time of operation.| 
|02|Year of Operation| Patient's Year of Operation.| 
|03|Pos Auxillary nodes| number of postive auxillary nodes detected.| 
|04|Status| Survival status.|

data = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/Term-1/master/Data/Projects/Breast_cancer_survival.csv')
print('Data Shape:', data.shape)
data.head()

### **Data Description**

- To get some quick description out of the data you can use describe method defined in pandas library.

data.describe()

**Observations:**
    
   - The average **age** of the patient is found to be **52.45 years**.
    
   - Around **25%** of patient have an age less than or equal to **44 years**.
    
   - Around **50%** of patient have an age less than or equal to **52 years**.
    
   - Around **75%** of people have an **age** less than or equal to **36 years**.
    
   - Minimum age of patient found to be **30 years**.
    
   - Maximum age of patient is found to be **83 years**.
    

### **Data Information**

- In this section we will see the information about the **types of features**.

data.columns.to_list()

data.info(verbose=True, memory_usage='deep')

**Observations:**

- There are four variables in total.

- All the columns are of integer data type.

- There are no missing values in data provided.

- Status column denotes the survival of patient or not.

- We will convert Status column to YES or NO. We map 1 to YES and 2 to NO.

- If status has value YES then it denotes the patient has survived 5 years or longer.
 
- And NO will denote the patient died within 5 years.


data = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/Term-1/master/Data/Projects/Breast_cancer_survival.csv')
CP_org_data = data.copy(deep=True) 


data['Status'] = data['Status'].map({1:'YES', 2:'NO'})
data.head()

data.head(20)

**Get the data points as per the Status field:**

data['Status'].value_counts()

**Observations:**

- We have data for **306 patients**

- There are **225 patients** who suvived for 5 years or later.

- There are **81 patients** not survived for more than 5 years or died within 5 years.

- Dataset looks **imbalanced** as proportion does not looks good. **Might need more data points to evaulate**.

-- **Details about patients who survived 5 years or more**


Status_YES = data[data['Status']=='YES']
Status_YES.describe()

-- **Details about patients who died within 5 years**

Status_NO = data[data['Status']=='NO']
Status_NO.describe()

---
**Observations:**

- The **position auxillary nodes** of patients are less who survived.

- The **mean year of operation** for survived and not survived patients is almost same.

- The **minimum age** of patient who survived is **30**.

- The **minimum age** age of patient who died is **34** but with no node.

- **There is no gaurantee that patient who died must have atleast a node**.

- **There is mean difference of 5 units of nodes between patients survived and not survived**.

# **5. Data Post-Profiling**
---


# Probability Density Function(PDF)
- For univariant analysis, use PDF, it takes single variable and it describes, summaries and find patterns in single feature.

sns.FacetGrid(data,hue='Status',height = 5)\
 .map(sns.distplot,'Age')\
 . add_legend();
plt.show()

Intention is to perform univariate data analysis using PDF. Here, it takes Age as single parameter.


**Observations:**

 - The survival chances of age group 30 to 40 are more.

 - There is dense overlap for age 40 to 60, it show less chances of survival.

 - Age between 60 to 75 have equal chances of survive or not survive. 

 - The most of the portion is overlapped, we can not predict the survival changes on Age parameter. 


sns.FacetGrid(data,hue='Status',height = 5)\
 .map(sns.distplot,'Years_of_operation')\
 . add_legend();
plt.show()

**Observations:**


 - Major portion is overlapped, particularly, year of operation from 1960 to 1965. It denotes that most of the operations happened during that period.

 - Year of operation from 1965 to 1967 shows some survivals.

 - It clearly shows most operations year are during 1958 to around 1970 and can not say about survival based on these data points. 


sns.FacetGrid(data,hue='Status',height = 5)\
 .map(sns.distplot,'Pos_axillary_nodes')\
 . add_legend();
plt.show()

**Observations:**

- Patients with zero or 1 nodes shows more suvival as graph looks dense.

- Patients with 10 to 20 nodes, decresing the possibility of survival.

- Patients with 20 or more nodes does not have possibility of survival.

# **8. Exploratory Data Analysis**
---



data.head()

Question:

How does age relate to number of nodes found?

# Initialize figure of size 15 X 7
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))

# Plot displot of age concerning treatment
sns.displot(data = data, x = 'Age', hue = 'Pos_axillary_nodes', height = 7, aspect = 15/7, bins = 20,color='red')

# Add some cosmetics
plt.title(label='Age vs Pos_axillary_nodes', size=16)
plt.xlabel(xlabel='Age', size=14)
plt.ylabel(ylabel='Frequency', size=14)
plt.xticks(size=12)
plt.yticks(size=12)
#plt.legend()
plt.grid(b=True)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Observation:

The pattern shows there are nodes observed between age 40s to 60s.

In 50s there are more nodes observed.

There is a spike after 40s for 0 to 1 node.

Question:
What is density distribution of Age feature?

# Initialize figure of size 15 X 7
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))

# Plot density distribution of age
sns.distplot(a=data['Age'], kde=True)

# Add some cosmetics
plt.title(label='Density Distribution of Age', size=16)
plt.xlabel(xlabel='Age', size=14)
plt.ylabel(ylabel='Density', size=14)
plt.xticks(size=12)
plt.yticks(size=12)
plt.grid(b=True)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Observation:

We can observe a peak between 40s to about mid-50s.

This implies that majority of people are from 40s to 65s.

Also, there is spike at mid of 50s.

Question: Which Age group has more nodes found?

# Get top 10 age groups and frequency
age_count = Counter(data['Age'].dropna().tolist()).most_common(10)
age_idx = [age[0] for age in age_count]
age_val = [age[1] for age in age_count]

# Initiate an empty figure
fig = plt.figure(figsize=[15, 7])

# Plot the barplot figure
sns.barplot(x=age_val, y=age_idx)

# Add some cosmetics
plt.title(label='Age Gorup and  Health', size=16)
plt.xlabel(xlabel='Frequency', size=14)
plt.ylabel(ylabel='Age', size=14)
plt.xticks(size=12)
plt.yticks(size=12)
plt.grid(b=True)

# Output the figure
plt.show()

# Initiate an empty figure of 15 X 7
figure = plt.figure(figsize=[15, 7])

# Plot the coutplot figure concerning Status and age
sns.violinplot(x="Status", y="Age", palette="gnuplot", data=data)

# Add some cosmetics
plt.title(label='Age vs Status', size=16)
plt.xlabel(xlabel="Status", size=14)
plt.ylabel(ylabel="Age", size=14)
plt.xticks(size=12)
plt.yticks(size=12)
plt.grid(b=True)

# Display the figure
plt.show()

# Initiate an empty figure of 15 X 7
figure = plt.figure(figsize=[15, 7])

#Years_of_operation Vs Status
sns.violinplot(x="Status", y="Years_of_operation", palette="gnuplot", data=data)

# Add some cosmetics
plt.title(label='Age vs Status', size=16)
plt.xlabel(xlabel="Status", size=14)
plt.ylabel(ylabel="Age", size=14)
plt.xticks(size=12)
plt.yticks(size=12)
plt.grid(b=True)

# Display the figure
plt.show()

# Initiate an empty figure of 15 X 7
figure = plt.figure(figsize=[15, 7])

sns.violinplot(x="Status", y="Pos_axillary_nodes", palette="gnuplot", data=data)
# Add some cosmetics
plt.title(label='Age vs Status', size=16)
plt.xlabel(xlabel="Status", size=14)
plt.ylabel(ylabel="Age", size=14)
plt.xticks(size=12)
plt.yticks(size=12)
plt.grid(b=True)

# Display the figure
plt.show()

**Observations:**

 - There were comparatively more people in the age group 45 to 65 who did not survive. Patient age alone is not an important parameter in determining the survival of a patient.
 
 - Patients with more than 1 nodes are not likely to survive. More the number of nodes, lesser the survival chances.
 
 - There were comparatively more people who got operated in the year 1965 did not survive for more than 5 years.
 
 - A large percentage of patients who survived had 0 nodes. Yet there is a small percentage of patients who had no positive axillary nodes died within 5 years of operation, thus an absence of positive axillary nodes cannot always guarantee survival.

# **Bi-variate Analysis**
---
**Scattered Plot**


sns.set_style("whitegrid")
sns.FacetGrid(data, hue = "Status" , height = 6)\
 .map(plt.scatter,"Age","Pos_axillary_nodes")\
 .add_legend()
plt.show()

**Observation:**

 - There are lot of patients with 0 nodes.
 
 - Patients with 0 nodes are more likely to survive irrespective of their age.
 
 - There are hardly any patients who have nodes more than 25.
 
 - Patients aged more than 50 with nodes more than 10 are less likely to survive.

**Pair Plot**

sns.set_style("whitegrid")
sns.pairplot(data, hue="Status", height = 5)
plt.show()

**Observation:**

 - Plot between nodes and year of operation looks better than other parameters.
